    <p>In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world.</p>
    <p>After winning the final of the 2024 T20 World Cup, Kohli announced his retirement from T20I.[8]</p>
    <p><B><U>Early life</U></B></p>
    <P>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.
     Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[10] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and
      request his father to bowl to him.[11]</P>
    <P><B><U>Career</U></B></P>
    <P>Virat Kohli's senior career began when he made his debut in List A cricket, playing against Services in the Ranji One-Day Trophy, but he did not have the opportunity to bat during the match.[1] On the international stage, he has been representing
     India since he was included in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka.
     With his national side, he won both the 2011 Cricket World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy alongiside several Asia Cups. He had previously led his side to the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup title. In league cricket, Kohli has played for the 
     Royal Challengers Bengaluru since the inception of the team in 2008.</P>
    <P><b><u>Playing Style</u></b></P>
    <p>Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour.[30][31] His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance,[32] and a resolute 
    grip on the bottom handle of his bat</p>

    <p>However, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump.[40] Bowlers often exploit this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.[41] This vulnerability has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on numerous occasions.[42][43] Cricket experts such as VVS Laxman
     and former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have acknowledged this weakness,[44][45] and former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries.[46]</p>
    <p>Kohli has garnered widespread acclaim and recognition as a preeminent limited-overs batsman by cricketing experts and aficionados alike.[47][48] In ODIs, he boasts an average of 65.5 runs when batting second and 51.7 runs when batting first.[49] He has amassed 27 of his 50 ODI hundreds in run-chases,
     and holds the record for the most hundreds scored when batting second.[51] In reference to his success while batting second, Kohli has expressed a fondness for the challenge of chasing, relishing the opportunity to test himself and demonstrate his ability to efficiently manage strike rotation and execute boundary hits.
     His colleagues admire his self-assurance, dedication, concentration, and work ethic, which are the driving forces behind his success.[53][54]</p>
    <p><b><u>Commercial investments</u></b></p>
    <p>Kohli invested in Indian Super League club FC Goa, which he co-owned as of 2024, reflects his ambition to support and cultivate the growth of football in India. Beyond the realm of cricket, this venture served as a future business opportunity for him, as he sought to diversify his portfolio after retirement from the sport.
    In November 2014, Kohli partnered with Anjana Reddy's Universal Sportsbiz (USPL) to launch the youth fashion brand WROGN. The brand specialized in men's casual wear clothing and entered into collaborations with prominent retail outlets such as Myntra and Shopper's Stop.[104] Additionally, in late 2014, Kohli became a shareholder
    and brand ambassador for the London-based social networking venture "Sport Convo". His involvement aimed to promote and raise awareness of the platform, which was focused on providing a space for sports fans to connect and engage with one another.[105]</p>
    <P> In 2015, Kohli invested a sum of ₹900 million (US$11 million) towards the establishment of a chain of health clubs and fitness centers throughout India. Dubbed as "Chisel", the network of gyms was established through a joint venture between Kohli, Chisel India, and CSE (Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment), the organization
     responsible for managing Kohli's commercial pursuits.[106] In September of the same year, Kohli expanded his portfolio of sports-related investments by becoming a co-owner of the International Premier Tennis League franchise, UAE Royals.[107] In quick succession, he also became a co-owner of the JSW-owned Bengaluru Yodhas franchise
     in the Pro Wrestling League.[108]</p>
